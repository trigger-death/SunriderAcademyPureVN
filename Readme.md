# SunriderAcademyPureVNPrivate
A patch to eliminate all non-visual novel elements in Sunrider Academy for a nice, smooth, non-carpal-tunnel-inducing story.


### Current BUGS:

* Route start freezes after selection
* Sola keeps texting me with her new Holo. She barges into my room in the morning and class during the day to text me.
* Did the buy confirmation even show up?
* Preferably eat at classroom after lovebento flag is set
